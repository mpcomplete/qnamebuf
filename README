I really like qname (vimscript #2317) and qbuf (vimscript #1910) and decided that it would be nice to combine them.  The author recommended I upload under my name.

Usage:
<F4> opens a list of the current buffers, and typing a string filters the list (by default ala lustyexplorer vimscript #1890).  All filtering is case insensitive (even if using Regular Expressions).  If there are many files open goes to a simplified view (just relative buffer number, and the filename with path), when filtered enough shows more information:
    1) Relative Buffer Number
    2) Current Buffer (%), Alternative Buffer (#), or if it is open in a visible split (=)
    3) File name
    4) Buffer number
    5) Relative file path

When Open:
    <BS> Delete last char entered
    <C-U> Delete all entered chars
    <M-L> Toggle between listed and unlisted buffers
    <M-D> bdelete the selected buffer, the explorer stays open and retains cursor position
    <M-C> Close the window containing the buffer
    <ESC> or <F4> close the explorer
    <CR> Open the selected file in the current window
    <M-S> Open the selected file in a split window
    <M-V> Open the selected file in a vert split window
    <M-T> Open the selected file in a new tab
    <UP> <DOWN> <LEFT> <RIGHT> navigates the selection
    <HOME> <END> move to the first/last item
    <M-1>, ..., <M-0> open the first, ..., tenth file in the list

Note, I wanted these to be <C-...> but <C-1>...<C-0> are not real key sequences.

Customization:
    g:qnamebuf_hotkey  Set the default key to toggle qnamebuf (defaults to <F4>)
    nmap <KEY> :call QNameBufInit(REGEXP, [SIZE], [FILE_NAME_ONLY], [ALLOW_LEADER])<cr>:~
If REGEXP is true use regular expressions instead of the lusty filter.
SIZE controls the size of the popup. Defaults to 1/2 of the visible lines (|&lines|/2).
If FILE_NAME_ONLY is false then use the path and filename otherwise just use the filename.  Defaults to true.
If ALLOW_LEADER is true then <LEADER>X can be used as a synonym of <M-X> in the list above.  Defaults to false.

Hints:
I find the following mappings very useful (jump to the ith file):
    nmap <silent> <M-1> :brewind<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-2> :brewind \| 1bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-3> :brewind \| 2bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-4> :brewind \| 3bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-5> :brewind \| 4bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-6> :brewind \| 5bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-7> :brewind \| 6bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-8> :brewind \| 7bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-9> :brewind \| 8bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-0> :brewind \| 9bn<CR>
When starting qnamebuf the numbers are displayed and this allows consistant access.
